# Task 2 Phishing Email Analysis Report

## 📧 Sample Analyzed
- Subject Response Required
- Sender service@intl.paypal.com service-paypal@outlook.com

## ⚠️ Phishing Indicators

1. Spoofed Sender Email
   - Sender claims to be from PayPal but the domain is actually `@outlook.com`.
   - Legitimate companies don’t send from free public email providers.

2. Urgent Language
   - Uses phrases like “Response required” and “unusual log in activity” to create panic.

3. Fake Resolution Link
   - Prompts users to log in and click Resolution Center — classic trick to steal credentials.
   - The actual destination of the link may lead to a fake PayPal login page.

4. No Personalized Greeting
   - Starts with “Dear” but does not include recipient’s name — a common sign of mass phishing.

5. Grammatical Phrasing Issues
   - Phrases like “Thank you for being a PayPal customer.” sound generic and suspicious.

6. Display Name vs. Real Email
   - `service@intl.paypal.com` is masked but the real sender is `service-paypal@outlook.com`.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Manual inspection of email structure
- Email header and link verification (hypothetical)
- Screenshot highlighting

## ✅ Summary
This is a credential phishing attempt disguised as a PayPal alert. It uses social engineering tactics (fear and urgency) to trick users into logging into a fake website. The use of a public email domain is a clear giveaway.

## 🧠 Learnings
- Always verify the sender domain
- Hover over links before clicking
- Lack of personalization is a red flag
